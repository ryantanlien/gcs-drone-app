### User Stories
1. As a user I can view the location of the geofence so that I can visualise the safety limits of the flying area.
2. As a user I can toggle between an autonomous following mode and a searching waypoint mode.
3. As a user I can edit the boundaries of the waypoints so I can dictate where the drone will search.
4. As a user I can send a command to the drone to return home so that I can retrieve it conveniently from its original launch point.
5. As a user I can confirm whether a found object is a drone or not so I can validate it for the drone to start tracking or continue searching.
